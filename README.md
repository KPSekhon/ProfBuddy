Inspiration: Students with disabilities face numerous barriers that prevent them from networking with professors.​These range from: -Lack of access to physical environments​-Lack of assistive technology and systems​-Negative attitudes held towards people with disabilities​.

In the school environment, this can contribute to non-disabled students overflowing the professors with questions after class, and some disabled students may feel intimidated for example if they have social anxiety.
